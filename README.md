This is a verilog project where I have created a frequency scaling & a pwm generator block using verilog in Intel Quartus Prime. I have then connected these two blocks using a block diagram (bdf) file and thus generated a complete verilog code for the whole circuit, in which, the input signal frequency is scaled from 50 MHz to 1 MHz and then again scaled down to 500 Hz to perform pwm to get a final 500 Hz pwm signal otput. I have then verified the working of the circuit using a testbench in Modelsim Altera.
